🧠 Parkinson’s Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project applies **Machine Learning techniques** to detect instances of Parkinson’s Disease from medical voice measurement data. The goal is to build and compare different models, identify the most accurate one, and evaluate its performance.

🔹 Steps Involved

1️⃣ **Data Collection** –  It contains biomedical voice measurements of people, some with Parkinson’s and some without.

2️⃣ **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, and prepared it for training.

3️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Analyzed the dataset to find useful patterns and relationships between features.

4️⃣ **Dataset Balancing & Scaling** – Balanced the dataset to avoid bias and scaled the features so that all models could perform fairly.

5️⃣ **Model Training & Evaluation** – Trained multiple machine learning algorithms and compared their performance.

## 📊 Machine Learning Models Used

The following models were trained and evaluated:

* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Naive Bayes
* K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
* XGBoost

## 🏆 Best Performing Model

After testing all models, the **Random Forest Classifier** gave the best results:

* Accuracy:** 99.61% → Correctly classified almost all cases.
* F1 Score:** 0.96 → Balanced performance in predicting both Parkinson’s and non-Parkinson’s cases.
* R² Score:** 0.86 → Strong ability to explain the variation in the dataset.
